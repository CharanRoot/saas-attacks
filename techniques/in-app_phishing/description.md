# In-app phishing

## Tactics
* Lateral Movement

## Summary
Once a foothold has been established by compromising a SaaS account that allows shared content or collaboration features, phishing attacks can be conducted in a more targeted manner within the app.


Instant messaging apps and other communications apps give increased credibility and options for social engineering scenarios aimed at phishing other employees to move laterally. Comment functionality is also present in many SaaS apps and is another avenue for phishing. Users treat comments and discussions inside internal apps with a high degree of trust, even for apps that are otherwise low-risk.
